1,Southeast Area,Athens,Georgia,Poultry Microbiological Safety and Processing Unit,Alternatives to Antibiotics and Genomics of Antimicrobial Resistance to Control Foodborne Pathogens in Poultry,2021-03-30,2026-03-29,"1. Identify and determine the presence and contributing factors for antimicrobial resistant foodborne bacteria in poultry and poultry-associated environments. 1.1. Determine the association of antimicrobial resistance (AR) in foodborne bacteria with resistance to biocides, metals, coccidiostats, and ionophores used in poultry husbandry and processing. 1.2. Evaluate the bacterial metagenome of retail poultry. 1.3. Identify and evaluate markers (resistance genes, genetic elements, virulence genes) to define outbreak and persistent foodborne bacteria in poultry. 1.4. Identify antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes (ARCs) and accumulation on plasmids. 2. Identify and evaluate biological and chemical intervention products and alternatives to antimicrobials to control or reduce foodborne pathogens in poultry. 2.1. Develop, validate, and produce multi-subunit vaccines to control Salmonella and Campylobacter in broiler chickens. 2.2. Develop antimicrobial peptides (AMP) as alternatives to antibiotics to reduce foodborne pathogens associated with poultry. 2.3. Identify and develop broad-spectrum bacteriocins to eliminate foodborne pathogens in poultry. 2.4. Utilize phage isolation, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and metagenomics to identify lytic phage that target Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli.","Microbial contamination of food products from poultry continues to be a leading cause of foodborne illness. Antibiotics have been used to treat bacterial infections since the mid-twentieth century. Because of their efficacy in treating and preventing disease, antimicrobials have also been widely used in poultry production contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AR) in foodborne pathogens and commensal bacteria. AR among these bacteria has the potential to compromise therapy and remains a global threat to human health. This research project represents a merger of two teams of scientists to provide solutions to colonization of poultry with human pathogens and AR in foodborne pathogens and commensal bacteria from poultry. Two major approaches will be employed: 1) development of alternatives to antibiotics for use in combating foodborne pathogens, and 2) investigations to accurately understand attributes of antimicrobial resistant foodborne pathogens and commensals. Alternatives to antibiotics include vaccines to control foodborne pathogens in live birds while innovative antimicrobial peptides, bacteriocins, and lytic phage will modulate the poultry microbiome to reduce or eliminate colonization by harmful bacteria from poultry to minimize AR and reduce risk to human health. Data generated on resistance to biocides, metals, coccidiostats, and ionophores used in poultry production and processing is a specific concern to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Research designed to determine ecological niches of foodborne bacteria and identify genetic characteristics facilitating transfer of resistance or a fitness advantage will also benefit FSIS. According to FSIS, increased knowledge of the microbial ecology of antimicrobial resistant pathogens on poultry will result in data that the poultry industry can utilize in development of improved pathogen management strategies. Identification of genetic markers which support survival, persistence, and dissemination of foodborne pathogens, especially those that are resistant to antimicrobials, is critical to this research priority. Data and technology from the proposed research will be used to assist other Federal agencies and the poultry and agricultural biotechnology industry in addressing AR in poultry resulting in safer products for the consumer.",In-House Appropriated,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/project/?accnNo=440256

3,Southeast Area,Athens,Georgia,Poultry Microbiological Safety and Processing Unit,Strategies to Control Poultry Associated Foodborne Pathogens at the Retail Level,2024-09-01,2028-08-31,1. Conduct a sampling survey of NRTE (not ready to eat) poultry products from the processing facility through retail to collect and compare Salmonella and Campylobacter isolates. 2. Determine factors which allow some Salmonella and Campylobacter to survive on meat from the poultry processing facility through to retail grocery markets.,"Objective 1. To survey NRTE poultry products from processing through retail, samples will be collected from poultry processing facilities that produce product for both tray pack (raw products for the retail grocery market) and for further processing (value-added, e.g. portioning, marination, par-fry, etc.). Samples will be collected at rehang, post-chilling, at packaging for transport, and at either retail stores or at the further processing facility prior to and following value-added processes. Isolates of both Salmonella and Campylobacter will undergo whole genome sequencing to identify relatedness between sampling points. Objective 2. At retail raw chicken of various forms (e.g. breast fillets, wings, ground, etc.) from various facility types (e.g. conventional, no antibiotics ever, organic, etc.) will be collected and evaluated for Salmonella and Campylobacter levels and prevalence. Retail isolates of both Salmonella and Campylobacter will be cross referenced with reported facility data and undergo whole genome sequencing. Following whole genome sequencing, isolates will be characterized with the goal of better understanding why those particular isolates are able to survive through to retail. With this information, we can move forward with novel direct interventions for the control of Salmonella and Campylobacter on raw poultry between regulatory testing and retail.",Cooperative Agreement,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/project/?accnNo=446873

Co-operator will perform live bird experiments in isolator units and in floor pens to assess colonization of different serovars. Carcasses will be processed in collaboration with ARS, and then Salmonella assessed.",Non-Assistance Cooperative Agreement,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/project/?accnNo=445046
5,Southeast Area,Miami,Florida,Subtropical Horticulture Research,"Characterizing Host-Plant Resistance to Cacao Diseases and Abiotic Stresses and Breeding Disease-Resistant, Stress-Tolerant Cacao Germplasm",2023-06-21,2028-06-20,"1: Breed and release novel cacao germplasm and cultivars with superior yield, host-plant resistance to diseases, and/or tolerance to drought and elevated temperatures. 2: Conduct research to identify genetic markers and develop integrated genetic maps to support cacao breeding for resistance to biotic stresses and tolerance of environmental extremes. 2.A: Identify association between SNP markers and resistance or tolerance to Badnaviruses, Poleroviruses, Lasiodiplodia spp. Colletotrichum spp., Diaporthe spp and Neofusicoccum parvum in cacao germplasm. 2.B: QTL discovery for resistance to BPR in six full sib families containing two different sources of resistance and gene identification.","Currently, the major losses in cacao are due to black pod rot (BPR), caused by several different Phytophthora species of which P. palmivora is the most common, frosty pod rot (FPR), caused by Moniliophthora roreri, and witches’ broom (WB), caused by Moniliophthora perniciosa. In addition, other emergent pathogens (Lasiodiplodia spp. Colletotrichum spp., Diaporthe spp and Neofusicoccum parvum) that in the past have been considered of minor importance have started to influence cacao production worldwide. Also, viruses (Badnaviruses and Poleroviruses) have been recently reported affecting cacao production in the Americas. Therefore, screening protocols for selecting germplasm resistance to these pathogens will be conducted by this project in the cacao germplasm accessions and in segregating populations at the USDA-ARS-TARS in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico since sources of resistance must be found. Even though, FPR, and WB are currently not found in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Nonetheless, this project will conduct a preemptive breeding strategy based on evaluating cacao segregating populations developed in Puerto Rico for host-plant resistance in countries where those diseases are present to develop disease-resistant varieties before these diseases arrive in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Several cacao accessions have been sequenced and their genome information is available. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) markers have been developed using this sequence information and will be used to genotype cacao accessions and segregating populations previously screened for resistance to these diseases. Associations between SNP markers and gene for disease resistance will be pursued during this project. Since Cacao breeding is a slow process, due to the tree’s long reproductive cycle. Generated genotypic and phenotypic information will be used in combination to identify Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associate with target traits using genome-wide selection (GWS) methodology as well as genomic selection models to strengthen the effectiveness of the selection process and accelerate the development of disease resistant cultivars. This research effort deliver cacao improve germplasm and save the livelihood of thousands of small farmers in the Americas.",In-House Appropriated,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/project/?accnNo=445215

7,Pacific West Area,Aberdeen,Idaho, Small Grains and Potato Germplasm Research,Improving Nutrient Utilization to Increase the Production Efficiency and Sustainability of Rainbow Trout Aquaculture,2019-12-28,2024-12-27,"The long-term objective of this research project is to provide stakeholders with products and information that can be used to improve sustainable production of rainbow trout. This will be accomplished by identifying novel ingredients with potential for use in aquaculture feeds, isolating new nutritional compounds and improving methods of isolating relevant dietary components, and verifying that formulations and dietary components are beneficial for fish growth and health with minimal impact on receiving waters. Feeds and improved rearing practices will be evaluated on existing commercial strains of rainbow trout. Traits of interest will be identified, and improved trout strains generated and tested. In addition to improvements in feed and strains, feeding and rearing practices will be developed for incorporation into best management plans. ARS researchers will work closely with stakeholders to ensure rapid dispersion of information to the industry. Specifically, during the next five years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Develop novel methods for creating and evaluating new ingredients and feeds. * Subobjective 1A: Innovate methods to make alternative protein ingredients containing encapsulated oils. (Liu, Vacant Nutritionist and Welker) * Subobjective 1B: Improve assay methods for acid insoluble ash and make it a reliable marker for digestibility studies. Objective 2: Develop feed formulation and processing technologies that minimize impacts on water quality. * Subobjective 2A: Develop feed formulation strategies that increase the stability of fecal castings (durability and particle size) and feed pellets to improve waste collection and water quality (particularly through addition of naturally occurring binders and modification of processing conditions). * Subobjective 2B: Determine the best performing combination of feed processing conditions, starch characteristics (e.g. amylose:amylopectin ratio, particle size, molecular structure), and diet formulation to enhance fecal and feed stability. Objective 3: Identify factors affecting the utilization of sustainable feeds and develop strategies to improve rainbow trout production systems. * Subobjective 3A: Use genomic methods and physiological assessments to analyze the effects of different formulated feeds and water quality conditions in different strains of rainbow trout. (Overturf and Welker). * Subobjective 3B: Improve rainbow trout to convert plant protein and lipids efficiently for enhanced growth.","Obj 1: Develop novel methods for creating and evaluating new ingredients and feeds. Research Goal: Generate new methods to increase oil content of trout feed via encapsulation to prevent lipid oxidation, oil leakage, and extend shelf-life. Develop an improved assay method for acid insoluble ash (AIA). Oil encapsulation of vegetable oils will be tested by spray drying and coacervation. Various plant protein dispersions will be prepared by testing mixes of soy or other plant proteins. Analysis of the microencapsulated particles and then the digestibility of ingredients captured within the capsules will measured and evaluated when fed to fish. Using different materials with varying levels of ash and AIA, a newly modified technique will compare the utilization of using AIA against existing techniques in determining digestibility of feed ingredients. If we cannot develop a product with 99% EE then 70% EE will be considered valuable. If AIA is low a commercial form of silica will be added. Obj 2. Develop feed formulation and processing technologies that minimize impacts on water quality. Hypothesis: Feed processing and addition of natural binders to commercial diet formulations will increase the durability and stability of trout feces and feed pellets in water. Strategies that increase the stability of feed material to improve water quality will be tested by evaluating processing conditions, the effectiveness of binders, gelatinization and the addition of additives to improve the flotation of diet and fecal particles. A commercial diet formulation for rainbow trout will be processed by extrusion and expansion pelleting. The pellet types/diets will be tested in growth trials with water quality monitoring. Using the best processing conditions three varieties of wheat & barley will be tested. The effects of grain source, feed processing and addition of cork on pellet and fecal characteristics, digestibility, growth, and water quality will be evaluated. If the tested binders do not provide adequate results additional binders may be tested. Obj 3: Identify factors affecting the utilization of sustainable feeds and develop strategies to improve rainbow trout production systems. Research Goal: Measure effects and interactions of trout strain, feed, and water quality to guide development of management practices to increase production efficiency and to use genetic selection to improve conversion of plant lipids to EPA and DHA. The diets from objectives 1 & 2 will then be tested in multiple strains of trout in water of worsening quality. The effect of diet on fish performance will be evaluated across water conditions and compared to performance for these strains and diets when tested under laboratory conditions. To determine the ability of rainbow trout to biosynthesize and convert plant lipid to EPA and DHA, we will generate & test family crosses generated from individuals with known muscle fatty acid ratios. Offspring will be reared on the complete plant-based feed & phenotypes observed & used for selection of the next generation of broodstock. As more robust analysis methods become available, we will implement these procedures in our analyses.",In-House Appropriated,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/project/?accnNo=437676
